# matlab-double-pendulum
This repo is a one-off repo for [apjanke](https://apjanke.net) and Yash to collaborate.

The code in here is not suitable for re-use and is not a software library or "real" project. Don't use it for anything. :)

## Usage
Clone this repo somewhere on your local disk, add its `src/` directory to your Matlab path, and hack away.

The main script to run is `my_double_pendulum.m`. Run `my_double_pendulum` at the Matlab command prompt and see what happens. When you want to tweak the initial conditions, edit `my_double_pendulum.m`. See `double_pendulum.m` for the actual logic and implementation code.

## Repo Structure
* `src/` - The main source code directory. This is what should go on your Matlab path (using the `addpath()` function`).

## License
BSD 2-Clause, because that's what the third-party Double Pendulum library this is based on was using.
Original Double Pendulum library from Matlab File Exchange: <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46991-simulating-chaotic-behavior-of-double-pendulum>

## Authors
